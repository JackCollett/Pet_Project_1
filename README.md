# ReactChat
A simple image editing platform which allows users to log in, select and save their image by altering its shape and colour.

# How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python(Flask) & PostgreSQL

The project uses Unsplash as the image provider, fetching collections via their API to display to users. I built the image display and styling with raw HTML and CSS to practice and reinforce my understanding of the fundamentals. 
Object-oriented programming was used to manage image data, allowing for cleaner code organization and easier future modifications. PostgreSQL is used to manage and store user creations, providing full CRUD functionality.
